# docker file has been uploaded to ~/dockers
# it was created on my mac and it has been uploaded to liulang6/my-private-repo

# notice
# 1. specify cram and crai in -iin
# 2. folder can't be specified for input
# 3. you can use the filenames in the comamnd line without specifying their directories. because they will be downloaded to another location which is the working directory
# 4. when using the docker image, specify the absolute path for any file in the docker image
# 5. dont use file ID (file-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx) for cram files. they can't locate the corresponding crai file based on file ID
