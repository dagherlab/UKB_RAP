here describes the index of WES final release
23157 coordinate is not given but I believe it is same as previous WES release in https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/refer.cgi?id=837

for chrX, the number of batch files matches
wget  -nd  biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ukb/ukb/auxdata/pvcf_blocks.txt

header names is 
Index
Chromosome
Block
First position
Last position

# perform this to modify the file


awk 'BEGIN { print "file_name,chromosome,starting_position,last_position" }
